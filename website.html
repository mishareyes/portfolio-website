            <p>
                CONGRATS! You've uncovered a <b>hidden page</b> ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜²ðŸ˜² <br><br>
                This website you're on right now is also a special project of mine. I have <b>personally designed, prototyped, and coded this whole website from scratch</b> over the Summer of 2022.
                Rather than use a website management platform such as Wordpress, Webflow, or Wix, I decided to code the website up myself.
                This was partly because I wanted extra practice for my frontend coding skills, but also because I did not want to be trapped within the templates that these platforms present.
                With code, I can be <b>as flexible as I want</b> with the design and even add in a little touch of my own personality and style into the final product. 
                I'll be outlining below each step of the design/code process that I went through to come up with this website.<br><br>
            </p>
            <h2>THE DESIGN</h2>
            <p>
                The website you see right now is <b>bursting with my personality</b>! I used four of my favorite colors â€“Â blue, peach, purple, and turquoise â€“ and incorporated them into colorful and bright gradients.
                I stuck to a solid black color for text that has great contrast with the bright colors I've used, perfect for readability on screens! 
                As for my <b>font choice</b> for the body, Inter is a good basic serif font which also helps with readability. 
                It is a bit more rounded than something like Avenir or Lato, so it matches the overall aesthetic of my website.
                I also wished for my header font to hold some significance for myself, so I chose one created by a <b>Filipino artist</b>.
                The font is called MaragsÃ¢, created by designer <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jad.otf/" target="blank"><i>John David Maza</i></a>, 
                and boasts Filipino type styles with tapered tips and flowing strokes and to mimic Filipino accent marks.
                <br><br>
                As for the overall design aesthetic, I went for <b>fun gradient blobs</b> all over the backgrounds of my pages. 
                This has been a recent trend, especially in website & ui design, where designers go for more rounded shapes rather than flat edges. 
                I find that this allows for a more interesting flow and adds an aspect of playfulness, which, again, says something about me!
                In a similar way, I tried my best to incorporate <b>interactive animations</b> in every page to keep site visitors entertained
                (which, in fact, is how you found this hidden page in the first place!)
                Lastly, adding a <b>solid black outline</b> around most of the shapes and buttons helps keep the design grounded and matches well with the black-colored text.
                <br><br>
                Friends and family to whom I've shown this website have all said how greatly it encapsulates me as a person, and I'm very proud of that fact.
                It's been a true pleasure working on this website and I'm so glad you're here to see it now! <br><br> 
            </p>
            <h2>THE PROTOTYPE</h2>
            <div class="_project_website--prototype">
                <p>
                    I worked on mapping out a prototype first on paper, then on <b>Figma</b>. The images below demonstrate my <b>paper prototype -> low-fidelity wireframe -> high-fidelity mockup process</b>.
                    I personally found it easier to stick to a neutral color scheme in the initial stages of planning, more so focusing on building a skeleton for the whole website.
                    After establishing a solid foundation, I was then able to focus my efforts on building a color scheme and finding pictures to place. <br><br>
                </p>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="./src/images/website/paper-prototype.jpg"/>
                    </div>
                    <div class="column">
                        <img src="./src/images/website/prototype.png"/>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h2>THE CODE</h2>
            <p>
                I used <b>vanilla HTML+CSS</b> in the creation of my website. Seeing as I wouldn't need to scale it and would only keep it as static pages, this seemed like the most straightforward route. 
                It also helped me brush up on some basic HTML/CSS concepts, such as flexbox and responsiveness for different device sizes.
                I also used <b>JavaScript</b> to make my navigation bar sticky as well as responsive. 
                <br><br>
                As I continued to add pages and projects to the list, it became more and more difficult to maintain individual CSS styles for all the components I wanted to create.
                It also looked quite messy to me and I was frequently repeating some styling methods. That's when I discovered <b>SASS</b>, a cleaner way to structure my CSS that introduces nesting, variables, and mixins.
                Since I was midway through the creation of the website at this point, it took some time to refactor different parts of the site -- but through this process I learned a lot about
                being detail-oriented and refactoring one part at a time -- skills that I find extremely useful in all the previous programming jobs I've undertaken.
                <br><br>
                The website is still a work in progress. So many new projects and designs to add but not enough time to add them. 
                But I find that every time I come back here, there's always something new to learn in website design. 
                And finding new opportunities for growth is always a fun time :)
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>
                And that concludes my work on my personal portfolio! I hope you enjoyed walking through my journey creating it, because I put a lot of my heart and personality into the entire process.
                This website is a manifestation of my dream to eventually grow into what the industry calls a 'unicorn developer' â€“ thriving at the intersection of both design and technology. ðŸ¦„
